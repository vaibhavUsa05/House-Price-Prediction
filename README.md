# House-Price-Prediction
Project: House Price Prediction

Summary:

Introduction:
The house price prediction project aims to develop a model that accurately predicts the prices of residential properties. This project utilizes various features such as location, size, amenities, and other relevant factors to estimate the market value of houses.

Data Collection and Preprocessing:
Extensive data collection is performed, involving gathering information on past house sales, property attributes, and market trends. The collected data is then processed, cleaned, and transformed to ensure its quality and suitability for analysis.

Feature Engineering:
In this phase, relevant features are selected and engineered to improve the predictive performance of the model. Techniques such as dimensionality reduction, handling missing values, and creating new derived features are employed to extract meaningful insights from the data.

Model Development:
Various regression models, such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting, are implemented to build the house price prediction model. The models are trained on a portion of the data and evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics.

Performance Evaluation:
The performance of the developed model is assessed using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared value. These metrics provide insights into the accuracy and predictive power of the model.

Model Refinement and Optimization:
Iterative refinement of the model is carried out by fine-tuning hyperparameters, adjusting feature selection, and exploring ensemble methods. This process aims to enhance the model's performance and ensure it generalizes well to unseen data.

Results and Conclusion:
The final model demonstrates promising accuracy in predicting house prices. The project's outcomes provide valuable insights into the key factors influencing house prices and can be utilized by real estate professionals, homeowners, and investors to make informed decisions.
